    "# A Recommendation System from Reddit\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, I aim to build a recommendation system for Reddit users (refered to as Redditors) using only their Reddit username.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the age of the internet consumers have an abundance of choice. From movies to songs to every concievable product, it seems like we have access to more choice than we can every hope to exercise. To make the traversal of this infromation more manageable, many companies build recommendation systems to help their users find more meaningful content or products, with great success. Platforms like Netflix and YouTube would simply not exist if they could not match users with personalized content given their vast content libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the value we gain from these recommendation engines come at a cost. These websites collect a tremendous amount of data from us. Google and Facebook particularly track our every movement, not just on the internet but, since the proliferation of smartphones, in the physical world as well. In addition, this is a huge barrier to entry for startups since the information that sites like Amazon and Facebook have about their customers allows them to provide better suggestions than new platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why I set out to see if I could build a recommendation system for users who I have not collected any prior information from. I plan to explore how we can leverage existing, public data about a user to suggest interesting items they may find interesting. I wish to deploy this into a site that encourages a community to share interests and ideas together rather than with a corporation that is trying to sell them something.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Products\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, I had to select which products I wanted to suggest. Netflix suggests movies, YouTube suggests videos and Spotify suggests songs, but Amazon suggests all of these things and a whole lot more. However, Amazon's product discovery algorithm is mainly built on items that someone has already purchased. As a result, a user only gets recommendations based on products they are familiar with. This is to Amazon's advantage, since these products likely have a very high conversion rate. However, it does not lend itself well to finding novel products that are based on our interests rather than our purchase history. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Reddit as a window to the soul\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is one of the most visited sites on the internet. It is a meta forum where users can post links to interesting items for every topic imaginable and discuss them with millions of other people. One of the strongest reasons why Reddit appeals to so many is because of its anonymity. It is one of the few forums where you can sign up without an email address, and is a far cry from something like Facebook where you have profile pictures and family information. Therefore, redditors can be open and expressive about their interests. Indeed, their personalities are associated with their Reddit usernames rather than their real names. This may lead to trolling but that is outside the scope of this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The true value of Reddit for this tool is that redditors comment on different topics, and we can access these topics. This means that by accessing the topics where they comment (known as subreddits), we can see which topics they are interested in. A clear limitation of this is that certain redditors only browse subreddits without commenting on them (colloquially known as 'lurking'). There is no way to access this information. Indeed, I do not even think that reddit makes the subreddits that a user is subscribed to public. Therefore, we have to use the comments and get the subreddits from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of ways that recommender systems can work. In order to harness the power of the social fabric of Reddit, I will use 'Collaborative Filtering'. Collaborative Filtering is a way to utilize user inputs to suggest products to similar users. Usually, it is done in the manner that if User 1 likes X,Y and Z and User 2 likes X and Y, there is a high probability that User 2 likes Z. This is the way that Amazon does it. However, we do not have access to the users purchase history and, like mentioned above, we want to suggest novel products that are independent of our target user's purchase history. Therefore, we extend the same concept to subreddits rather than products. In our case, we postulate that if User X and User Y comment on similar topics, they have similar tastes and therefore we can recommend the products that User X likes to User Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For Collaborative Filtering to work, however, we need a seed dataset of products to suggest to our users. This is where most platforms fail in their recommender systems. Without this critical mass of data, there would be nothing to suggest. However, upon research, I found a particular subreddit that provided me with a workaround; r/randomactsofamazon. \n",
    "\n",
    "R/RandomActsOfAmazon is an offshoot of an idea that the Reddit community has had for a long time, the act of randomly gifting something to another redditor. It originated with R/RandonActsOfPizza where, like the title would suggest, redditors would gift each other pizza delivered to their doorstep. R/RandomActsOfAmazon takes this concept further and allows redditors to post wishlists of things they want from Amazon. These redditors then hope that some stranger might like them and buy them a gift from their wishlist. This data is perfect for me as this contains the products that a particular redditor wants/thinks are cool. \n",
    "\n",
    "After contacting the moderators for r/randomactsofamazon, I was referred to http://n8fq.org/temp/links.sql This is an sql dump of the entire database of active users on r/randomactsofamazon. It is a public site that is used to power functionality for r/randomactsofamazon and I was given permission to use it. I was able to parse this sql dump into a database and convert it into a csv file in another script (see github repo). I will use this csv file for my recommendation engine. I will also encourage users to gift their 'Reddit Twin' (i.e. the redditor in my database who is thier closest match) something from their wishlist.  However, since I do not have informed consent for every reddit user in my database, I will not disclose the reddit id of their twin. Amazon holds the address of the wishlist owner secret to allow for safe, anonymous gifting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets get to the good stuff."

    "I tested my tool with 10 of my friends and got some feedback. It was clear that the results were not in the best format possible. I am returning wishlists rather than individual products. Some of these wishlists have mundane items like snacks and giftcards which is a poor recommendation for users. However, there are some interesting products like board games and books that my friends found intriguing. Of course, I want to test the tool on more than 10 people. I plan on publishing this tool online and trying to use reddit to generate traffic to it. I want to encourage people to tip their reddit match or buy them something from their wishlists, as this would incentivize them to submit their own Amazon wishlists and make my seed dataset richer. I hope that as more and more people use the tool and sign up, the product starts recommending cooler and cooler things for people to find. This cycle of generosity and altruism married with finding novel products, in my opinion, would be a great tool for redditors and showcase that an efficient peer to peer recommendation engine can be built by sharing interests with each other rather than with a company."
